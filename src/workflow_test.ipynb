SIMPLE: Direct questions that can be answered immediately without tools or with single tool use\\n   - Examples: \"What is photosynthesis?\", \"Define machine learning\", \"What\\'s the capital of France?\"\\n   - NOTE: Simple math like \"2+2\" still requires calculator tool but counts as SIMPLE\\n\\n   !ALSO: It can be a logical reasoning or explanation task that does not require tools.\\n   \\n2. MODERATE: Questions requiring 2-4 tool calls or basic multi-step analysis\\n   - Examples: \"Search for recent news about AI\", \"Analyze this CSV file for trends\", \"Calculate ROI from this data\"\\n   - \"Compare two datasets\", \"Summarize multiple documents\"\\n   \\n3. COMPLEX: Multi-step problems requiring planning, multiple tools, and sophisticated reasoning\\n   - Examples: \"Research market trends and create investment strategy\", \"Analyze multiple data sources and predict outcomes\"\\n   - \"Build comprehensive report from various inputs\", \"Multi-stage data processing with validation\"\\n\\nMOST OF THE LOGICAL TASKS ARE SIMPLE, UNLESS THEY REQUIRE TOOLS.\\n\\nASSESSMENT CRITERIA:\\n- Number of distinct steps likely needed (1 = Simple, 2-4 = Moderate, 5+ = Complex)\\n- Tool complexity and dependencies between steps\\n- Data processing requirements and validation needs\\n- Need for intermediate reasoning and synthesis\\n- Risk of failure without proper step-by-step planning\\n- Presence of calculations (automatically requires tool usage)\\n\\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:\\n- Any calculation/counting task requires tools (affects complexity assessment)\\n- File analysis tasks usually need multiple steps (load + analyze + calculate)\\n- Research tasks typically need search + fetch + synthesis steps\\n- Comparison tasks need separate analysis steps for each item being compared\\n\\nRULES:\\n- SIMPLE queries may bypass planning for non-calculation tasks\\n- MODERATE queries benefit from lightweight planning\\n- COMPLEX queries require full planning with fallbacks\\n- When in doubt, err toward higher complexity\\n- Calculation tasks are never truly \"simple\" due to mandatory tool usage\\n\\nAnalyze the query and respond with your assessment.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='db109164-6e6e-4c1f-82bb-93d6d9b64e6a'),\n",
