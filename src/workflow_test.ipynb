MODERATE: Questions requiring 2-4 tool calls or basic multi-step analysis\\n   - Examples: \"Search for recent news about AI\", \"Analyze this CSV file for trends\", \"Calculate ROI from this data\"\\n   - \"Compare two datasets\", \"Summarize multiple documents\"\\n   \\n3.

This must be provided or confirmed; I will not assume or look it up in this step.\\n\\nPlanned method and chosen tool:\\n- I will use the safe_code_run tool to perform an exact, case-insensitive search and count of occurrences of the year string in the abstract text.\\n- Inputs to safe_code_run will be: the abstract text and the year string (e.g., \"1998\" if that is the year—do not provide a year unless confirmed).\\n- The code will:\\n  1. Normalize both text and year to ensure consistent matching (e.g., treat the year as a literal token).\\n  2. Count all occurrences of the year string as a substring (this will capture mentions like \"(1998)\", \"1998,\", \"1998.\" etc.).\\n  3. Optionally, return the count and the list of matched contexts or indices for validation.\\n\\nExpected outcome:\\n- A single integer indicating how many times that year appears in the abstract text, plus (for validation) the matched snippets or positions so I can confirm correctness before marking the step complete.\\n\\nValidation before marking STEP COMPLETE:\\n- Verify the returned count is an integer and matches the number of returned match contexts.\\n- If the abstract text or the year is missing, I will not call the tool and will request the missing input(s).\\n\\nI will proceed to call safe_code_run only after you provide the extracted abstract text and confirm the publication year for \"The Propitious Esculent.\"\\n</REASONING>', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 976, 'prompt_tokens': 3722, 'total_tokens': 4698, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 576, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-CIvLh1dqE7QuuSDa0ncSQUnGnNv5B', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--ed2c6eb1-df53-4a80-9a5d-e54d6a069bed-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3722, 'output_tokens': 976, 'total_tokens': 4698, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 576}}),\n",
